# Plant-Planner
This is a planner that allows one to add plants to a MongoDB database and be able to see its events, harvests, and other details about the plant

# Config
This is how I am connecting to my Database, the token is hidden in a config.json file but the rest of the code shows how one would connect.
If you wish to use your own data following the same schema, you just replace token with whatever your connection string is.

# Models
This is the schemas for the database models for Plants, Events, and Harvests are stored. These are for reference for what each database model looks like and the names for each component.

#Public
The EJS files for how the pages would be displayed on the web browser, this is able to call from JS files to display all the info requested.
